# Shopfront

## The project will start as a database whereby:
* as an administrator, you can add products, which consist of an id, a price and a stock. ✔️
* as a regular user you can buy 1 of the products. ✔️
* as the owner you can make payments or withdraw value from the contract. ✔️

## Eventually, you will refactor it to include:
* ability to remove products. ✔️
* co-purchase by different people. 🕗
* add merchants akin to what Amazon has become. ✔️
* add the ability to pay with a third-party token. 🕗
